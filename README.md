# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolution Neural Networks are widely used in object recognition, classification and also speech recognition.
* In the first part this project we implemented the main components of every CNN namely the 
**Convolution layer** and the **Pooling Layer**,  [SourceCode](https://github.com/Stamatios-Korres/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/tree/master/mlp). We also implemented the whole process of training a network; **Forward and backward passing, parameters update, mini-batch training** Convolution was implemented using **Scipy's Convolve2d()**. 

* In this second part we implemented a CNN using **PyTorch** to investigate how diffrent
set-ups and configurations affect a CNN's performance. We experimented on the effect on various dimensionality reduction methods, like **Dilated Convolution, Strided Convolution Average & Max Pooling**.
