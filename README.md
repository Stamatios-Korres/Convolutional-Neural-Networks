# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolution Neural Networks are widely used in object recognition, classification and also speech recognition. In this project we implemented the main components of every CNN namely the 
**Convolution layer** and the **Pooling Layer**,  [SourceCode](). Convolution was implemented using **Scipy's Convolve2d()**. In this second part we implemented a CNN using **PyTorch** to investigate how diffrent
set-ups and configurations affect the CNN performance.
